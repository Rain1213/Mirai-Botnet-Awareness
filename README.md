# Mirai-Botnet-Awareness
Paper on creating awareness and suggesting solutions to the masses on the dangers of a botnet malware Ã  la mode known as Mirai Attack.

Mirai is a worm-like family of malware that infects IoT devices. It has affected hundreds of thousands of IoT devices since it first emerged in 2016. Mirai scans the devices that run on the ARC processor which runs over the Linux operating system. If the default username and password combo are never changed, Mirai can simply log into the device and infect it. Mirai is mutating, which means it keeps on giving birth to different variants. Botnets are dangerous as they have the potential to impact virtually every person whether or not they use IoT devices or even the Internet. 

To curb this spread you will have to do your part.
